1) In code firstly we are printing the welcome message.
2) Declared the variable "bill" and initially value is set to zero.
3) Code starts with "while True"; which means the loop will run until it is interuppted.
4) The code is in a while loop which asks the user to input their height in centimetres.
5) The "if" statement checks whether entered value is an integer.
6) If user enters a number which is integer, so it assign that value to height; otherwise it continues with else clause of if statement which will print "Invalid Input".
7) If user enters integer value so it will be converted to centimeters.
8) The second "if" statement checks whether the user enters a number within range of 1- 120.
9) If user enters a number in a range of 1 -120 , then it prints "You Can't Ride and if user enters a value over 120, it prints "You Can Ride" and continues with the loop.
10) Now the code is in a loop which asks the user enter their age. 
11) The "if" statement checks whether entered value is integer.
12) If user enters a int number, so it assign that value to "age" variable; otherwise it continues with else clause of if statement which will print "Invalid Input".
13) Now if the user enters a integer value, so the code will check if age is not in range of 1 - 56, it will print "Age not Valid".
14) Otherwise if the age is in between 12-18 years old, they will pay 7 dollars; if the age is between 19-44 years old they will pay 12 dollars; if age is between 45-56 years old , there will be no charge and if age is outside of these ranges(1-11 years old), they would have to pay 5 dollars.
15) The code asks the user if they want photos.
16) The code has two test cases:
  i)  If they choose "1", then it print out total bill with pictures taken,
  ii) If user don't want photos then choose option "2", it will print total bill without pictures taken.    
17) For this we have used match case statement which allows you to evaluate an expression against a list of values.
 18) The code continues until someone inputs either of those numbers, at which point it matches them with one of two messages depending on whether they chose "1" or "2".

***************************
- Short Description of Project :
1) The code is meant to calculate the total cost of a rollercoaster ride.
2) The code starts by asking for the height in centimeters, which is inputted into the program and then checked against a range of 1-120.
3)  If it is not within that range, an error message will be displayed on screen and the user can choose whether or not they want to ride the rollercoaster.
4) After entering their age, if it is between 12-18 years old, then they will pay 7 dollars; if they are 19-44 years old, then they will pay 12 dollars; if they are 45-56 years old, then there will be no charge; otherwise (if their age is outside of these ranges), then they would have to pay 5
